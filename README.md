# COLLECTION ITEMS

## What is it?

This is a remake of api I originally mad in node.express [Github Page](https://github.com/ShaneButtCodeNL/collection-api) to learn .NET6. This API needs to be run in order for my project [Collection APP](https://github.com/ShaneButtCodeNL/CollectionApp) to work. This api connects to an online MongoDB database That stores logins and various items I collect.
Some requests require a JWT webtoken to make such as adding/editing/removing entries.

## Download

CLI

### `git clone https://github.com/ShaneButtCodeNL/CollectionItems.git`

## How to run

### 1. `dotnet run`

This will run the api on [localhost:7000](localhost:7000).

### 2. `dotnet watch`

This will run a development server that opens a swagger page that will show api endpoints

## **_IMPORTANT_** If the api can't connect it may just be the DB is paused from in activity Feel free to message me to restart it. [Contact Page](https://shanebuttcodenl.github.io/#contactMeMarker)
